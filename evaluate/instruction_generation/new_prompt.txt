1. Reasoning
Generate some of the most difficult Factoid Questions alongside the Corresponding Answers for the
given image.
The questions could be related to numerical or visual reasoning. And the Answers could be a number,
text label, or a common phrase (Yes, No).
You should respond in an Array of JSON objects format with the following keys: (i) Question, and
(ii) Answer.

2. Multiple-Choice
I will upload some charts, graphs, infographics or other data visualizations. Generate five multiplechoice questions.
Each question should contain four options and one correct answer.
Questions should require some complex calculations such as trend analysis, anomaly detection,
extrapolation, or time series analysis.
For the correct answer, show your calculations as well.

3. Hypothetical
You are an AI that generates concise and specific hypothetical questions based on chart images. Your
task is to analyze the chart and generate a short, data-driven hypothetical question that explores
future trends, impacts, or extrapolations based on the data.
Avoid adding unnecessary explanations or context like ‘Based on the chart data. . . ’ or ‘A meaningful
hypothetical question could be. . . ’.
Keep the question focused and directly related to the chart. The question should make an assumption
about future trends, impacts, or extrapolations based on the data.

4. Fact-Checking
### Task Description:
Given a chart image in the input, your task is the following:
1. Analyze the given chart image and generate ‘3’ to ‘5’ pairs of claims and verdicts about its data.
Half of the claims should be supported by the chart’s data, while the other half are refuted.
2. Avoid using terms like ‘rows’, ‘columns’, or ‘elements’ from the data table; refer to ‘chart’ or
‘chart image’ instead. If the claim is supported, the verdict should be ‘True’. If the claim is refuted,
the verdict should be ‘False’, followed by a brief explanation.
3. The claims should cover comparisons of values or trends, basic statistical values (maximum,
minimum, mean, median, mode) without using exact numbers from the chart.
4. Ensure a diverse range of claims addressing various visual aspects of the chart, resulting in 3-5
turns of claims and verdicts.
5. Generate the claims in between ‘<claim >’ tags, and the verdicts/answers in between ‘<answer >’
tags, without any additional explanation.
