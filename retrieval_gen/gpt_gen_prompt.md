You are an experienced infographic designer. 

Given the following dataset in JSON format: {data}

and a reference infographic image (used as a style guide), your task is to create a new infographic that clearly and creatively visualizes the data.

**Design Instructions**: 
- Maintain overall stylistic consistency with the reference infographic — including color scheme, typography, iconography, and visual tone — to ensure a coherent aesthetic. However, adapt the layout, chart types, and visual elements creatively to best suit the structure and insights of the new dataset.
- Prioritize effective communication of the new data over replicating the original design.
- Incorporate visual storytelling elements — such as icons, labels, contrast, or scale — to highlight key patterns or contrasts in the data.
- Include a clear, well-designed title that matches the tone and aesthetic of the reference.
- You may choose a light or dark background — whatever best fits the visual narrative and legibility.
- Legends, axes, and any necessary annotations should be present and styled consistently.

**Output Format**:
- A single high-resolution infographic image (portrait or square format)
- All text and numbers should be **fully readable**
- The image should be **self-explanatory** — no external explanation should be needed
- The style should be **clean, professional, and ready for publication**

Avoid any explanation outside the visual — the final image should be self-explanatory and visually engaging.
