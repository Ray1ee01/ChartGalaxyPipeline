There is a piece of text: "{text}". It may only be the title of a poster, or it may consist of two parts: the title of the poster along with annotations or introductory text such as a preface. Please assess the following questions and provide your answers in JSON format:

Does the text "{text}" consist only of the title?
Output the title part of the text "{text}".
If the text "{text}" includes annotations or explanatory text in addition to the title, output the annotations or explanatory text part.
If the text "{text}" includes annotations or explanatory text in addition to the title, how many words does the explanatory text contain? Does the annotations or explanatory text part contain more than 10 words?
