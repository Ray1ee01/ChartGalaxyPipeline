Generate a text image with the content of "Reforestation Success Rates". Generate a text image with the content "Reforestation Success Rates" following these specifications:

The text should be divided into two lines. The first line will contain "Reforestation Success" and the second line will be "Rates." 

Emphasize the word "Success" by enlarging the font size and changing its color to #0058D3, making it visually stand out from the rest of the text.

Decorate the text with a small tree icon, replacing the letter "t" in "Reforestation." This adds a thematic touch that complements the message of the text.

Use a font style with a natural, organic feel, suggesting growth and vitality, like a bold serif font combined with a smooth sans-serif for "Rates." 

Apply an artistic effect that creates a slight texture resembling tree bark to the text, reinforcing the theme of nature and reforestation.

For the color scheme, use the color #ABD0E4 for the text, except for the emphasized word "Success," which should be in #0058D3, providing a harmonious and calming aesthetic suitable for subjects related to nature and the environment.

Ensure the background is pure white to maintain focus on the text and icon, providing a clean and uncluttered visual experience.

The overall layout should adhere strictly to the line allocation requirements, ensuring clarity and emphasis are used effectively to attract and maintain the viewer's attention.
