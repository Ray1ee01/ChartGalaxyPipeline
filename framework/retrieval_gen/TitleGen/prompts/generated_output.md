Generate a text image with the content of "Tech Giants' Growth Analysis". Create a text image with a pure white background featuring the title "Tech Giants' Growth Analysis". The text should be split into two lines: 

1. Line 1: "Tech Giants' Growth" 
2. Line 2: "Analysis"

For emphasis, enlarge and bold the words "Tech Giants'" in Line 1, using a vibrant blue color. Line 2 should be in a standard black font without emphasis. 

Decorate the text by replacing the apostrophe in "Giants'" with a small, sleek icon of a rising graph to symbolize growth. 

Use a modern, futuristic font style for the text, giving it a clean and professional appearance. Additionally, apply a slight shadow effect to the text to enhance depth and make it pop against the white background.

Ensure the text is arranged according to the specified line allocation requirements, with ample blank space above and below the text for a balanced look.
