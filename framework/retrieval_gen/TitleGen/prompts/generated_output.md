Generate a text image with the content of "Smart Home Trends 2027-2031". Design the text image with a pure white background featuring the title "Smart Home Trends 2027-2031". The text should be arranged in 2 lines to optimize clarity and emphasis. The first line will read "Smart Home Trends" and the second line will contain "2027-2031". 

For emphasis, the phrase "Smart Home Trends" should be highlighted by enlarging the font size significantly compared to the second line. To add visual interest, consider using a gradient color scheme for the letters of "Trends", transitioning from a vibrant blue at the top to a deep green at the bottom. 

To enhance the text visually, replace the letter "o" in "Home" with a stylized, minimalistic house icon, which reflects the theme of smart homes. 

Select a modern, futuristic font that conveys innovation and sophistication, ensuring it is easily readable at a distance. Incorporate a sleek, glossy effect on the text to give it a polished look, while maintaining a clean and uncluttered appearance on the white background. 

Remember, the text must strictly adhere to the specified line allocation requirements for optimal layout and clarity.
